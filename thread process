What is Thread in Java : 

1) Both process and Thread are independent path of execution but one process can have multiple Threads.

2) Every process has its own memory space, executable code and a unique process identifier (PID) while every thread has its own stack 
in Java but it uses process main memory and share it with other threads. 

3) Threads are also refereed as task or light weight process (LWP) in operating system 

4) Threads from same process can communicate with each other by using Programming language construct like wait and notify in Java and 
much simpler than inter process communication. 

5) Another difference between Process and Thread in Java is that it's How Thread and process are created. It's easy to create Thread as 
compared to Process which requires duplication of parent process. 

6) All Threads which is part of same process share system resource like file descriptors , Heap Memory and other resource but each Thread
has its own Exception handler and own stack in Java.
